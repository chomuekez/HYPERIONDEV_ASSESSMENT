I WOULD REQUEST THE STUDENT TO SHARE THE PROJECT WITH ME ON GITHUB, 
I WOULD THEN DOWNLOAD AND WORK ON THE PROJECT TO FIX THE BUG.
AFTER I HAVE SUCCESSFULLY FIXED THE BUG, I WOULD GET BACK TO THE STUDENT TO
EXPLAIN WHERE HE OR SHE WAS MISSING THE POINT.

ALTERNATIVELY, I CAN USE TEAMVIEWER TO CONNECT TO THE STUDENT'S LAPTOP. I CAN THEN 
WORK ON THE PROJECT WHILST EXPLAINING TO THE STUDENT THE CAUSE OF THE BUG.
